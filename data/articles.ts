    title: 'Revolutionary AI Breakthrough in Medical Diagnosis',
    excerpt: 'New artificial intelligence system achieves 99% accuracy in early cancer detection.',
    content: 'Researchers at Stanford Medical Center have developed an artificial intelligence system that can detect early-stage cancer with unprecedented accuracy. The breakthrough represents a potential revolution in medical diagnosis and could save millions of lives through early intervention.\n\nThe AI system, called MediScan Pro, analyzes medical images using advanced machine learning algorithms trained on over 10 million patient scans. Initial trials show the system can identify cancerous cells up to six months earlier than traditional methods.\n\n"This technology could fundamentally change how we approach cancer screening," said Dr. Jennifer Walsh, lead researcher on the project. "Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes."',
